Basic Math Concepts

Addition:
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers. The symbol for addition is +.
Example: 2 + 3 = 5
When adding, the order of numbers doesn't matter (commutative property): 2 + 3 = 3 + 2

Subtraction:
Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. The symbol for subtraction is -.
Example: 5 - 2 = 3
Unlike addition, subtraction is not commutative: 5 - 2 ≠ 2 - 5

Multiplication:
Multiplication is repeated addition. The symbol for multiplication is × or *.
Example: 3 × 4 = 12 (which is the same as 4 + 4 + 4)
Multiplication is commutative: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3

Division:
Division is the process of sharing or grouping equally. The symbol for division is ÷ or /.
Example: 12 ÷ 3 = 4
Division is not commutative: 12 ÷ 3 ≠ 3 ÷ 12

Fractions:
A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts:
- Numerator (top number): how many parts we have
- Denominator (bottom number): how many equal parts the whole is divided into
Example: 3/4 means 3 parts out of 4 equal parts

Decimals:
Decimals are another way to represent fractions. The decimal point separates the whole number part from the fractional part.
Example: 0.5 is the same as 1/2

Percentages:
A percentage is a fraction with 100 as the denominator. The symbol for percentage is %.
Example: 50% = 50/100 = 0.5 = 1/2
